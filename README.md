# Useful links and sources
In this repository I've collected all resources I used and using as of today to become a good software developer. I've divided the context of the file based on topics, I'm currently interested in or have been so some time ago. Let's make it clear at first, I aimed to learn a java backend stack, so the main focus is to learn Java programming language and its derivatives, but also I'll cover some fundamental things, which is common for everyone who is interested in IT fields, like algorithms and data structures, databases, git, etc. 

## Context
1. [Java](#java)
2. [OOP](#oop)
<!-- 3. [Databases](#databases)
4. [Git](#git)
5. [Competative Programming](#competative-programming) -->
